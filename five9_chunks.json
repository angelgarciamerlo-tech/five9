  "Console Overview Basic Components Logging in Accessing the Administrator Console During Domain Maintenance Inactivity Timeout Logging Out Saving Data Navigating Between Pages and Tabs Terminology Troubleshooting Standard Error Messages Using the Administrator Interface The Five9 contact center is cloud-based software provided as a service for creating and managing contact center operations. As the Five9 Administrator Console gains functionality, we will add new features to this guide. Currently, you must use both the Administrator Console and Five9 Java Administrator applications to fully administer your Five9 Contact Center. Admin Console is the new administrator tool for Five9. As part of this new tool, we are introducing new processes for the administrator to manage the contact center. The Admin Console introduces detailed permissions that enable the administrator to create permission sets for users which enable them to have specific functions, such as create, edit, delete, or update for the different objects in your contact center (see Permissions and Permission Sets). These detailed permissions replace the Java Administrator application permissions that enabled full access to managed objects. Within Admin Console, Java Administrator application permissions are not honored. This means that if you have permission to manage campaigns in the Five9 Java Administrator application, you",
  "contact center (see Permissions and Permission Sets). These detailed permissions replace the Java Administrator application permissions that enabled full access to managed objects. Within Admin Console, Java Administrator application permissions are not honored. This means that if you have permission to manage campaigns in the Five9 Java Administrator application, you may not be able to manage campaigns in Admin Console. Admin Console is zero trust; until an administrator provides you permission you cannot perform any actions. To access the Admin Console, a user must be granted access to use a Five9 application, like Admin Console, ADP, Supervisor, and others. Applications will start to replace the Java Administrator application roles that provided access to ADP, Supervisor, and other applications. About the Administrator Console Multiple Administrators 17 Administrator Console • Administrator’s Guide Multiple Administrators Admin Console supports multiple administrators working concurrently.

About the Administrator Console Accessing the Administrator Console During Domain Maintenance 21 Administrator Console • Administrator’s Guide Accessing the Administrator Console During Domain Maintenance If your company uses the Five9 Managed Geographic Redundancy (MGR) feature, and you are logged into your Five9 console when maintenance is required or an outage occurs, your Five9 server is moved to a backup data center.

  "console when maintenance is required or an outage occurs, your Five9 server is moved to a backup data center. Administrators, supervisors, and agents receive notices about the status of server changes during the switchover process. MGR messages do not currently show in the Five9 Admin Console. Managing Maintenance Moves During a major service disruption, Five9 may move your application server to a backup data center until the issue is resolved. Five9 MGR is designed to mitigate major service disruptions that might otherwise result in extended downtime for the Five9 Virtual Contact Center platform. Domains are typically operational in the backup data center within 15 minutes. Once service is restored in the primary domain, Five9 returns affected domains to their primary data center. Inactivity Timeout The Five9 Administrator Console will timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity. For the purpose of timeout, activity is any action that interacts with the Five9 system, such as saving data, API calls, or loading new data. 30 minutes of inactivity requires you to refresh authentication. Example: You open several pages, such as Users, Campaigns, and Permissions. Loading these list-display tables pulls data from the Five9 system.

Note About the Administrator Console Logging Out 22 Administrator Console • Administrator’s Guide Adding a new item, such as enabling a permission for a user, interacts with the Five9 system and is activity for timeout purposes. Logging Out When you are done using the Administrator Console it is recommended to log out, and not just close the browser window. In the bottom left corner is an icon with your initials on it. Select your initials icon to logout. Saving Data Saving data within the Administrator Console happens automatically as you navigate away from pages.

In those cases use the Save icon in the top right corner, otherwise select the Done action to save your work and return to the previous page. Many changes are immediate and saved to the Five9 system once they are input or selected, when this happens there is a spinning wheel indication that will pause the Administrator Console until the save action complete.

A second, or duplicate, instance of that object will not be created. Navigating Between Pages and Tabs Data is automatically saved when you navigate between tabs.

Another navigation area to be aware of is the Go Back icon, when you click this button the system checks to see if the current page contents have been modified and will prompt a Save, Discard, or Cancel dialog to allow you to save the data or navigate away without saving.

Overview With API access control, you can create and manage scope-based access control lists, assign machine user credentials, set expiry dates for credentials, and modify and format views of the list. API access control allows you to manage and control access to APIs using access tokens, authorization, and appropriate permissions (scopes). See Configuring API Access Control to configure access. Key Concepts Scopes Scopes are permissions included in access tokens, specifying actions that can be performed on the API. They define specific actions an application can perform, such as creating, updating, viewing, or registering events. Families Families are groupings of related APIs or endpoints that share common access policies or credentials, making it easier to manage access controls efficiently. This organization ensures that applications have the appropriate level of access while maintaining security and order.

When configuring dispositions, you can also set the value for call variables that should be stored for reporting purposes when that disposition is used, or when any disposition is used. With call variables, you can gather more information about each interaction. For example, you can collect error codes generated by IVR and find out how many times a speech input was provided, an account balance retrieved, and customer satisfaction survey results. In addition to U.S currency, all currency variables support the British Pound and Euro currencies. You can use call variables in connectors and IVR scripts to send information, for example, to third-party systems. Optionally, call variables can be stored to use in reports. The variables are organized in groups, similar to classes used in many programming languages. When using a variable, follow this syntax: [Call Variable Group Name].[Call Variable Name] Call.mediatype In reports, you can summarize call variable values across calls to provide the total sale amount per agent or per campaign based on individual sale amounts from each call.

For calls from a campaign to be answered before calls from other campaigns, increase the priority by one. 3 Configure the Outbound Settings as desired. a Maximum charge (no decimals): Dollar amount for the maximum long distance charges. The campaign stops automatically when this amount of long distance charges is reached. A setting of zero means no limit. b Dialing time-out (in seconds): Enables you to configure how long the system waits before an unanswered call is disconnected and logged as No Answer. In other words, this is how long the dialer rings a number. Sometimes this time period is equated to number of rings but it is actually measured in seconds. The default setting is 20 seconds. The dialing time-out allows you to increase the ring time (not the number of rings) in an effort to reach more answering machines or give the called party more time answer. For autodial campaigns it is sometimes beneficial to increase the dialing timeout in an attempt to capture more answering machines.

  "For autodial campaigns it is sometimes beneficial to increase the dialing timeout in an attempt to capture more answering machines. Warning: This setting has a direct effect on how answering machines and no answers are reported. If the timeout is increased, expect to receive more answering machines and fewer no answer dispositions. More importantly, if your list is producing a lot of unanswered calls, increasing this setting means it takes longer to process the list and potentially increase the agent idle time. Important: Telemarketing regulations in the U.S. require that calls ring for a minimum of 15 seconds. If you are running telemarketing campaigns, do not reduce this setting to less than 15 seconds. c Dialing attempts: The counter for the Number of Attempts counts all dial attempts for phone numbers in a list record, including redials due to disposition settings.

Connectors help agents find information or trigger an action in campaigns where connectors are defined. You can search for call variables that contain customer data, and also parameters, such as call length, handle time, wrap-up time, skill transfer, queue time, and hold time. Connectors perform GET or POST tasks on information in contact records. Important: Use secure URLs and the POST method when using parameters containing sensitive data. You can't save connectors with sensitive data using GET calls or non-secure URLs. Call records contain data fields for all parties that handled the call, the associated campaign, contact information, and call disposition.

Call records contain data fields for all parties that handled the call, the associated campaign, contact information, and call disposition. You can substitute this data in the connector URL and execute these APIs as the agent processes the call. You can access Connectors using the home page card or by selecting Manage Campaigns from the sidebar navigation. Connectors Understanding Connectors 125 Administrator Console • Administrator’s Guide Understanding Connectors Connectors comprise a URL, a script that defines the action taken by the connector (a GET or POST command), some delimiters, and one or more parameters that define the data to retrieve from the URL or post to the target URL, such as a database or third- party tool. The URL, script, and keywords come from your application, form, or tool, not from Five9 applications. Connector Parameters You append connector parameters as a field or constant to a URL.

  "Connector Parameters You append connector parameters as a field or constant to a URL. Proper parameter formatting automatically generates URL strings. Best practices for parameters are: l Parameter names are case sensitive. l The string must be in URL format. l Connectors can include one or more parameters and their associated keywords. l Connectors often display a static Web page, knowledge base, or list. Parameter Types The type of call data handled by the parameter is identified by its name. Agent Data Agent(s) who handled the call in which the connector was executed.

  "example, if you create a CRM field named email_address, the parameter would be listed as Customer.email_address. To display a list of all possible parameters, navigate to Connector > Parameters. Domains not enabled for internationals numbers must conform with the North American Numbering Plan for outbound calls. Outbound calls for domains with international dialing enabled must conform with the local dialing format or use a maximum of 15 digits, and start with a plus sign (+) and country code. You can set connectors to display customer phone numbers in the local format as a pop-up window. GET and POST Methods in Connectors GET calls have a maximum length of 2048 characters after the Five9 contact parameters. This is the length of the URL as executed on the agent's computer with all requested contact data. URL lengths vary based on the maximum number of characters set for requested contact field names. You must enable agent browser security settings to execute POST methods in connectors. See also Connector Execution in the Agent’s System.

You configure connector parameters in the Connector Parameters tab. Connectors Executed in Browsers Browsers can execute a connector in a new window or embedded in the browser. Connectors URL Strings 127 Administrator Console • Administrator’s Guide The Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explore browsers do not accept mixed content without special configuration. For example, if you combine secure and non-secure URLs, such as in an integration, the connector may not open in the browser. Best practice is to always use secure URLs and/or enable Execute in Browser. You must always use HTTPS to embed connectors for Web agents. Otherwise the connectors do not display. Connectors triggered by a disposition execute in a new browser window on call completion. To prevent their website from displaying in an iframe on another website, many websites (such as google.com) use the x-frame-options:SAMEORIGIN header. To use the Embedded tab in Agent Desktop Plus, connectors must use the embedded URL call.

  "websites (such as google.com) use the x-frame-options:SAMEORIGIN header. To use the Embedded tab in Agent Desktop Plus, connectors must use the embedded URL call. URL Strings The URL defines the host name, the script to execute, the parameters passed to this script, and the keywords that map to the system data. Five9 Administrator Console supports standard HTTP and secure HTTPS protocols. You can use HTTPS for the system disposition connectors. For secure connections, you can use certificates when the external Web server uses a root certificate (unsigned/self- signed public key certificate). You can import CRT files or enable Accept All Certificates. Use this syntax: http://www.domain.com/page.htm?keyWord_1=@parameter_1@&keyWord_2=@par- rameter_2@ domain.com Domain where the URL exists. The URL standard contains a port specification, for example: www.domain.com means http://www.domain.com:80. The default port is generally omitted. Five9 URLs do not use a port other than 80. page.htm Name of the script being called to perform the GET or POST method.

The question mark is added automatically to the URL. @ Must precede and end each parameter definition. & Another keyword-parameter combination follows this symbol. keyWord_ n=@parameter@ Define the data to GET or POST. Parameter Names The Five9 contact center provides a set of standard parameter names for connectors. Parameters in the connector URL must begin and end with an at sign (@), for example, @Customer.first_name@. You must separate keyword-parameter pairs with an ampersand (&). The type of call data handled by the parameter is identified by its name, see Parameter Types. Parameter names are case sensitive. The Customer data parameters are the contact fields available in your configuration, including the Five9 default fields and any custom fields. For example, if you create a contact field called email_address, the parameter is Customer.email_address.

If an outbound campaign that uses these Answering Machine prompt/IVR dispositions dials many cell phone numbers, Five9 recommends setting a longer greeting time, such as 40 seconds, due to the often longer voicemail greeting messages. You can use branching logic or dynamic Text-to-Speech when leaving a message. For example, to configure an IVR script that plays a personalized message from the agent assigned to the call, you can configure a Case module, with the Agent.user_name variable and connect the branches to one Play module for each agent. Another example would be to leave a message with dynamic Text-to-Speech, which can play information such as an account balance to a client.

For inbound calls, the speed of answer is the interval between the call entering an ACD queue and connecting to an agent. Service level is measured by comparing the SOA value to the threshold value.

Configuring Default FTP Settings This section describes how to configure the default FTP settings to transfer call recordings and reports from the Five9 VCC server to your FTP server. In addition to these default settings, you can also configure specific settings for each campaign. Campaign and disposition settings override default settings. Depending on your business requirements, choose FTP, FTPs, or FTPes. FTP is adequate if the path to the storage location for the recordings is already encrypted, such as when the location is at your site and you have implemented a VPN. Otherwise, to protect recordings in transit, Five9 recommends SFTP. The configuration for each option is similar, except that with SFTP, you can upload an optional security key file. If you intend to use a key, you must obtain a private key file from your SFTP server administrator before starting configuration. For more information on keys, see Creating Public and Private Keys.

Exporting Recordings and Transcripts Configuring FTP Options for Scheduled Reports Configuring FTP Options for Transcripts Creating Public and Private Keys To configure the FTP transfer settings, select Actions > Configure. Exporting Recordings and Transcripts You can record agent calls. Each recorded call is stored in a single file in WAV format. The recordings are stored for 30 days in the properties of the agent’s account (see Managing User Recordings). If you have an FTP server, recordings are transferred in real-time to your server. You can choose to store your recordings at your regional telephony Point of Presence (PoP) rather than a Five9 data center that may be located outside of your region.

In reports, the service level is calculated for each call whether or not the service level was met. Service levels are expressed as percentages. Domain Settings Setting KPI and Global Parameters 76 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide Defining Service Level Setting the Speed of Answer Threshold (seconds). This threshold value determines the service level for a call. If you want calls to be answered within 30 seconds, set the threshold value to 30. The default value is 20 seconds. For inbound calls, the speed of answer is the interval between the call entering an ACD queue and being connected to an agent. Service level is measured by comparing the speed of answer (SOA) value to the threshold value. Service level is boolean and set as follows: l 1: SOA <= SOA threshold; the agent answered the call in time. l 0: SOA > SOA threshold; the agent did not answer the call before the threshold. Calls that are disconnected while in the queue for less than the threshold value",

Calls that are disconnected while in the queue for less than the threshold value are excluded. Setting the Speed of Answer Minimum Time (seconds). Calls shorter than this setting, such as abandoned calls and wrong numbers, are excluded from statistics. This parameter is not used in outbound campaigns because these campaigns do not use the ACD. The default value is five seconds. Including queue callback wait time in SL/SOA calculation. When enabled, waiting time for queue callback is included in the service level calculation that is shown in reports and Supervisor Plus applications. This option is disabled by default. Examples This topic describes how service level is calculated in different scenarios. For inbound examples, the speed of answer and the minimum call length are set. For outbound calls, the speed to answer is set. In all cases, statistics are calculated for one hour, for example: 1:00 – 1:59 PM. Abandoned calls are excluded from calculations.

  "delays. International dialing is augmented by defining calling regions to subdivide your global coverage service area. Segmenting your call patterns to identify local, or regional, calling areas also helps to overcome any latency issues often associated with international dialing. Determining Your Business Needs A best practice is to classify your calls by region, which means that you route calls to the agents nearest to the call origin or termination. For example, your callers from Japan would talk to agents in Japan, and your Australia region callers talk to agents in Australia. To accomplish this, you need local numbers, regional station IDs, and campaigns configured to route regions calls to local numbers. Planning for Overflow Call Traffic To accommodate peak hours, off hours, and business continuity, you may want agents in one region to back up agents in another region for uninterrupted support or overflow calls. You can define an alternate region as a backup for your excess call traffic. For example, 100 Japanese-speaking agents can process from Japan while 10 Japanese-speaking agents in Australia are available to receive calls when all agents in Japan are busy. To reduce call delays, remember the distance that the voice must travel. Five9 Global",

  "dialing automatically can slow down list processing. The dialing queue is limited to 20 concurrent calls. If you do not sort the list, the maximum suggested number of records is 500,000. If you sort the list by using more than one field, Five9 recommends that the list not exceed 10,000 records. Smaller lists are quicker to upload; campaigns start faster. You can process your list for upload at any time. Files larger than 50,000 records will upload in 50,000 increments in the background. Five9 processes 50,000 records from each file in the job queue before returning for another 50,000 records. This is to make certain that upload speeds are not compromised and that all jobs have enough numbers to begin any production campaign. This may cause interruptions to running campaigns as additional 50,000 row increments are uploaded. To maximize performance, periodically remove from the list all records that are not new or in progress.

The number is redialed at the time specified in the disposition as opposed to the list. l If a number receives the same Redial disposition consecutively, the dialer stops attempts when the Number of Attempts has been reached. l When using Redial with a redial timer, the alternate phone numbers for the contact record are not dialed until this redial number is tried again. The concept is that we do not know the outcome of the original number yet, so we try it again first before attempting other numbers for the contact record. l When using Redial without a redial timer, the alternate phone numbers for the contact are dialed without waiting for the redial number to be tried again. l If Allow Agents To Change Redial Time is selected, the redial timer set by agents works in the same way",

For the agent, the disposition enables an additional menu to select a reactivation time. The time configured in the Activate After setting is also shown to agents as the default option for this disposition. When an agent specifies a reactivation time, the phone number is reactivated by the campaign at the designated time and the dialer may later deliver the call to any available agent that is qualified for the campaign. Without an activation timer: A record contains three numbers. The first number is assigned a do-not-dial disposition. Because every contact record can have up to three numbers to dial, the other two numbers can still be dialed. However, if Apply to All Numbers in This Contact Record is enabled, none of the numbers can be dialed. With an activation timer: A called party asks not to be called again for at least 2 hours.

The vertical dialing mode does not wait until the next pass through the list to check if the timer has expired. The vertical dialing mode emulates a redial timer and redials the record when the time has expired, regardless of list position. Final Disposition For Contact Record Dispositions When you apply a final disposition, the contact record, including alternate phone numbers, is not dialed again by the campaign. A final decision has been made, such as Application taken or Not interested. This type of disposition has one option: Apply To Campaigns Using This Disposition.

Digital Channel Disposition Types Digital channel dispositions allow an agent to select a disposition on interactions, such as chat or email interactions, without closing the text interaction. This has no impact on voice calls. Digital channel disposition types cannot be changed once they have been saved. Global Dispositions You can create unified dispositions to use globally for text channel and voice interactions. These dispositions can be defined as open, enabling your agents to track the status of an interaction without closing that interaction, or closed to assign the final result of that interaction.

  "dispositions can be defined as open, enabling your agents to track the status of an interaction without closing that interaction, or closed to assign the final result of that interaction. This is different from voice channel dispositions, which are always closed. You can create a disposition named Waiting for Status that can be applied to an email interaction when the agent is waiting for a customer reply. The ability to keep this interaction open helps to track an issue without creating a new interaction for a continuing conversation, such as “Would you like for me to issue you a refund for the entire purchase price or would you prefer that I send you a replacement part?” Digital channel dispositions may not be changes once they are saved. When converting campaigns using SCC dispositions to using global dispositions, Five9 recommends that you use identical naming to prevent duplicate dispositions in reporting.

Ensuring that Dropped Call Percentages Comply with FCC Regulations FCC regulations require that the percentage of dropped calls from all outbound campaigns fall within specified guidelines. The maximum percentage allowed for the call abandonment is currently 3% for each campaign every 30 days. However, you should refer to the FCC regulations for requirements and call abandonment rate calculation to ensure that you have the up-to-date information. Five9 modified the calculation for the dropped call percentage to ensure that custom dispositions are not included in this calculation. Note: The abandon rate 2-second rule calculation option allows you to use a queue time of 2 seconds or higher to identify outbound calls as abandoned.

For example, to configure an IVR script that plays a personalized message from the agent assigned to the call, you can configure a Case module, with the Agent.user_name variable and connect the branches to one Play module for each agent. Another example would be to leave a message with dynamic Text-to-Speech, which can play information such as an account balance to a client. These options currently work only with automated dialing by outbound campaigns - such as, Power, Predictive, or Progressive dialing modes. Preview dialing, manual calls, and inbound calls are not supported, and the prompt or IVR script is not played.

  "as No Answer. In other words, this is how long the dialer rings a number. Sometimes this time period is equated to number of rings but it is actually measured in seconds. The default is 20 seconds. Dialing timeout allows the administrator to increase the ring time (not the number of rings) in an effort to reach more answering machines or give the called party more time to pick up the phone. For autodial campaigns it is sometimes beneficial to increase the dialing timeout in an attempt to capture more answering machines. This setting has a direct effect on how answering machines and no answers are reported. If the timeout is increased, expect to receive more answering machines and fewer no answer dispositions. More importantly, if your list is producing a lot of unanswered calls, increasing this setting means it takes longer to process the list and potentially increase the agent idle time. Telemarketing regulations in the U.S. require that calls ring for a minimum of 15 seconds.

  "variables are custom fields that store call data instead of contact records. During a call, they can be used and updated in the IVR and by agents. When configuring dispositions, you can also set the value for call variables that should be stored for reporting purposes when that disposition is used, or when any disposition is used. With call variables, you can gather more information about each call. For example, you can collect error codes generated by IVR and find out how many times a speech input was provided, an account balance retrieved, and customer satisfaction survey results. In addition to U.S currency, all currency variables support the British Pound and Euro currencies. You can use call variables in connectors and IVR scripts to send information, for example, to third-party systems. Optionally, call variables can be stored to use in reports. The variables are organized in groups, similar to classes used in many programming languages. When using a variable, follow this syntax: [Call Variable Group Name].[Call Variable Name] Call.mediatype In reports, you can summarize call variable values across calls to provide the total sale amount per agent or per campaign based on individual sale amounts from each call.

Transferring User-to-User Information with Call Variables You can use call variables to transfer User-to-User Information (UUI) data between the VCC and other telephony systems, such as other call centers or PBX systems, by using the SIP protocol. UUI data is information not pertaining to the call, such as an account number. The call variables values are transferred without modification.

The UUI data is sent from the Five9 VCC to a third-party call center or PBX system in outgoing SIP calls. The call is transferred from the caller to the agent. The UUI data is received by the Five9 VCC in incoming SIP calls. A customer calls an 800 number assigned to the Five9 VCC. In the VCC IVR menus, the customer enters information, such as account number and personal identity, that corresponds to call variables. The information captured by the IVR is attached to the call in UUI or other SIP headers. The VCC IVR transfers the call to a third- party call center or PBX system, which extracts the data to route the call to the appropriate skill group or agent. Once the agent accepts the call, all data originally entered by the caller is transferred to the agent. The agent does not have to enter that information again.

Variables can have any format, value, restrictions, and default values. Choose the format expected by the remote side to which the SIP trunk is linked. For example, if you expect UUI data to be an integer, create an integer variable. Your remote call center or PSTN system expects UUI data in the body of a User- To-User SIP header to be an integer. Your call variable for UUI data is named my.var. Its type is integer. The IVR script validates the format of the value when assigning it to the variable. Five9 inserts the value of my.var in the initial SIP message of each outbound call as follows: User-To-User=<my.var-value>.

The dialing process is typically handled by the dialer. Outbound campaigns may use one of four dialing modes: the predictive, power, or progressive dialer modes to dial through a list of contacts and deliver connected calls to your agents.

An additional preview dialing mode allows agents to preview contacts and individually dial their numbers. For more information, see Configuring Dialing Modes, Options, and Call Processing in Outbound Campaigns. When managing outbound campaigns, you must understand how the dialer works and how lists are processed. For more information, see Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns. Inbound Campaigns Inbound campaigns are used to receive customer calls coming from a DNIS. The calls are processed according to your rules in the IVR script of the campaign. With the inbound campaign, you can use customized greetings and create different scenarios for Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 10 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide Interactive Voice Response (IVR).

  "l Incoming calls can be sent to agents based on availability or skill with custom prompts and hold music. l You can create loops and branching. You can collect caller information. l You can use contact data. l If queue times are long or agents are unavailable, callers can leave a message. l Calls can be forwarded to a third party when agents are not available. l You can prioritize inbound call traffic. etc. To create IVR scripts that automate skills-based call routing, see Routing Users to Skill Groups in the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Administrator's Guide. The campaign must be running to answer inbound calls. Otherwise, callers hear a busy signal. Autodial Campaigns Autodial campaigns are designed to dial phone numbers in a list and to use call- progress detection to understand whether the call was received by an answering machine or person. When a call is answered, it follows a predefined IVR Script. The most common flows include leaving messages to the called party. You can also optionally configure the auto-dialer so that your customers can interact with a menu of options and messages, and even allow them to add their phone number to the do-not- call list",
  "follows a predefined IVR Script. The most common flows include leaving messages to the called party. You can also optionally configure the auto-dialer so that your customers can interact with a menu of options and messages, and even allow them to add their phone number to the do-not- call list without interacting with an agent. So, with Five9’s advanced capabilities you can define many different flows to meet your business needs. And each successfully connected number will follow the call flow defined for the campaign. The call flow can even pass an outbound call to an agent. When one of your customers needs to talk to a live agent, the call can be queued up for the next available agent. When your agents are connected to live parties, they can follow the scripts you've written and record the results in the Five9 contact history. Autodial Campaigns can dial multiple numbers at the same time based on the number of lines available for your account and the number of lines allocated to the campaign. There is an ability to stop dialing based on agent availability. Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 11 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide If your call flow does not",

Autodial Information in Reports Telemarketing Rules Types of Autodial Campaigns Campaign Profiles for Autodial Campaigns Dispositions for Autodial Campaigns Testing Autodial Campaigns Autodial Information in Reports To determine if a contact hangs up before listening to the entire message, check the total length of the call in reports.

You could also verify the path in the IVR flow that the customer took by creating a report and looking at the ivr_flow column. To view the IVR path taken for each autodial call, look at reports, which may contain an ivr_flow column. This column shows the IVR modules used by the call. Because the ivr_flow field uses the module name, Five9 recommends to identify each step of the call flow by naming each module accordingly. Telemarketing Rules You are responsible to know and comply with the telemarketing regulations in the regions in which you operate. Consult your compliance team if you are not sure about applicable laws. In the U.S., autodial campaigns are governed by the Federal Trade Commission’s telemarketing sales rule. You may not use an autodialer for telemarketing purposes. You may use an autodialer only if you have an existing business relationship with the people you are calling. For example, they may be used for collections, feature announcements, reminders to existing customers, or for exempt organizations, such as charities or political campaigns.

Important Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 12 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide Types of Autodial Campaigns Autodial campaigns comprise these categories: l Basic Autodial Campaign: Plays a message to answering machines. The message in the Play modules can be the same or different. l Smart Autodial Survey: Plays a prompt to the connected party and records the response in a contact field. If an answering machine is detected, the system disconnects the call. See Configuring Autodial Agent Linkback Campaigns. l Automated message delivery campaigns: Plays a recorded message to persons and answering machines, for example to broadcast a recorded message. l Agent Linkback: Usually plays a recorded message to answering machines but gives persons the option to connect to an agent.

Campaign Profiles for Autodial Campaigns All campaign profile features can be used with autodial campaigns. For example, you can use a campaign profile to start and stop dialing automatically, based on the time of day. Use the Start At and Stop After settings to set the start and stop times. You can adjust more settings by using profiles. In the example below, the campaign dials between 8AM and 9PM to phone numbers in the number1 contact field of list records.

Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 14 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide See Outbound Campaign General Properties. Dispositions for Autodial Campaigns Because many autodial calls do not reach an agent, to be assigned a disposition, autodial campaigns can record a disposition in some IVR modules. The purpose of IVR dispositions is to provide reporting of where the call disconnected in the IVR flow. For example, your autodial campaign plays a message when a person answers and disconnects the call with the Hang Up module. The disposition in the Hang Up module is recorded as the result of the call. In this case, the disposition for the Hang Up module can be message left - person. Autodial campaigns have two disposition categories: l Agent dispositions are used when a call is connected to a Five9 agent. l IVR dispositions are used by the system when a call is disconnected during the IVR flow.

Therefore, a contact record can have up to three dispositions per campaign. However, depending on disposition type and specific settings, a disposition may affect the entire contact record. Configuring Campaigns Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns 50 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide l Each number in the contact record has its own disposition, time stamp when the disposition was set for the number, and a counter recording the number of dialing attempts.

If a campaign has been started in basic mode, the default campaign profile settings are used. Basic mode enables all three phone numbers for dialing (if using multiple phone numbers per record) and sets the dialing hours to 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM. You can use the advanced mode to run campaigns using custom campaign profiles. Using campaign profiles, administrators can disable phone numbers if using multiple phone numbers per record, set different dialing hours per number, configure list dialing orders, add contact record filters, and configure a number of other options. Disposition Type. The dialer skips list records if they have been assigned a disposition by Redial or Do Not Dial (DND) for campaign dispositions with enabled timers, and the timers have not yet expired. Contact numbers updated after a DND disposition has been applied have no dis- position associated and are exempted from the DND timer restrictions. In List Penetration dialing mode, redial-type dispositions without timers and Do Not Dial Number for Campaign dispositions with expired reactivation timers are dialed, based on their position in consecutive list cycles.",

In List Penetration dialing mode, redial-type dispositions without timers and Do Not Dial Number for Campaign dispositions with expired reactivation timers are dialed, based on their position in consecutive list cycles. In Vertical list dialing mode, the dialer attempts to dial numbers or contacts with expired timers as soon as possible if they are higher in the configured sort order or list position. The dialer does not retry a number that has already been assigned a disposition and if its disposition does not have Redial or Do-Not-Call (which has timeout and can be dialed) type.

Only the Final Disposition of a manual call affects Dialer behavior with regard to the record. Manual calls do not affect campaign runtime statistics (except Final dispositions). Available Agents. An outbound campaign in power or progressive mode reserves an agent before making a call. The campaign makes calls to customers for the reserved agents.

  "for the reserved agents. If a call made for an agent fails, the campaign removes the hold on the agent. The agent can be reserved again by the same campaign or another campaign. The estimated number of calls at a given time for such campaigns can be calculated by the following formula: Calls to Agents Ratio * Number of Reserved Agents. Assumptions: l Campaigns have the same skills. l Any campaign call can be assigned to any agent. l Calls to Agents Ratio = 1. 1 Blue campaign is first - it is reserving two agents. 2 It makes calls to customers for the reserved agents.

Configuring Campaigns Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns 53 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide 6 Red campaign is reserving the agent and making call for the agent. Call Priority. Call priority is measured on a scale of one to 100, with one being the lowest priority. Call priority determines which calls in queue are answered first. Higher priority calls are typically answered before lower priority calls, regardless of when they enter the queue. Additionally, call priority may also be adjusted in the IVR Skill Transfer module during queue time and affected by your task distribution settings. Basic inbound and autodial campaigns not using a campaign profile begin with a call priority of 10. Basic campaign outbound calls begin with a priority of 50 for preview dialing mode and 60 for all other dialing methods. Campaign profiles begin with an initial priority of 60 for all call types.

The Predictive Dialing Mode option is designed for contact centers and businesses that regularly perform large numbers of outbound calls. Predictive Dialing mode is an aggressive outbound algorithm that is best suited for high volume outbound environments with a large pool of agents dedicated to outbound activity. Predictive Dialing mode should never be used with less than 15 agents consistently active in the campaign at all times. Agents skilled for a campaign that uses Predictive Dialing should be committed to that campaign, and not be skilled for other campaigns, particularly inbound campaigns. Sharing agents with other campaigns or having inconsistent staffing levels may result in a high number of abandoned outbound calls.

If an outbound campaign that is set for list penetration dialing is out of numbers, it may take up to 30 minutes for the campaign to begin dialing the inserted numbers.

Based on internal testing and customer feedback, setting the Voice Detection Level from 4.5–10 seconds yields the best call analysis results.

By analyzing the audio signal for a reasonable duration, the AMD module can make timely classification decisions while still capturing enough information to accurately differentiate between human and machine responses. The Normal - 4.5 sec setting provides efficient and reasonably accurate classification of connected calls, and helps optimize call handling processes. We recommend using this setting to get started. The Accurate - 10 sec setting places focus on accuracy and precision. Ten seconds provides the AMD module time for a more thorough analysis of the call audio signal, which can result in more accurate determinations of whether the connection is human or machine. This reduces the chance of misclassifying calls, leading to more appropriate routing or handling. With a longer analysis time, the AMD module has more data for an informed decision.

Managing IVR Script Schedules for Autodial and Inbound Campaigns IVR schedules associate IVR and Visual IVR scripts with one or more campaigns. These scripts are required for inbound campaigns. Scripts contain custom greetings and prompts that provide instructions to callers and route calls. Default Schedule When you create a campaign, it contains a default IVR schedule that is active seven days a week and 24 hours a day. By default, IVR scripts run from Sunday (day 1) to Saturday (day 7). You can add a script to the default schedule, but you cannot modify the days and time of activity, and you cannot delete it.

Don't use quotation marks. Constraints are uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters (recognition considers cases the same). Non-alphanumeric characters, such as dashes or spaces, are ignored. The entries can't contain special characters: those with accents (for example, è) or tildes (~). By default, each constraint has no spaces between the elements. You can add a header with a list of directives to the top of the file. The header must consist of lines beginning with a double colon (::) followed by a directive (no spaces). Directive Description ::DELIMITED This file uses spaces between each element in each con- straint. Spaces are ignored.

The base priority is either 10, the default, or the value that is set as Initial Call Priority in the associated campaign profile. See the Campaign Administrator's Guide for more information. The resulting value must still be within the range one to 100. If your script has multiple IVR modules that route the calls to the same queue, the behavior is as in the following example. l If both modules have the default priority settings, calls are prioritized by the wait time in the skill transfer module that they are in. So calls that are already waiting in SkillTransferA are routed to Skill W before a call that is just entering SkillTransferB. l If SkillTransferB has a higher Priority setting, all calls in SkillTransferB are routed to Skill W before any calls from SkillTransfer A are sent there.",

So calls that are already waiting in SkillTransferA are routed to Skill W before a call that is just entering SkillTransferB. l If SkillTransferB has a higher Priority setting, all calls in SkillTransferB are routed to Skill W before any calls from SkillTransfer A are sent there. Example You have SkillTransferA and SkillTransferB, both routing calls to Skill W. The Skill Transfer module has a default Priority setting of Increase By: 10. So if the campaign has no associated campaign profile and you do not alter the mod- ule’s default setting, the call has a priority of 20.

IVR Examples Creating an IVR Loop 322 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide Adding and Configuring the If/Else Module If a caller makes an invalid entry or no entry at all, the IVR use the No Match branch. The first module in the No Match branch is used to check the value of the loop variable. We use the If/Else module to do the comparison. If the value is equal to zero, we use the If branch. If it is greater than zero we use the Else branch. The Else branch is the loop. Since the initial value of the loop variable is 2 the first time through, the If/Else module uses",

  "rules, language used in the text of the interaction, and waiting time in the media queue. Voice interactions are always prioritized and distributed before chat interactions. When multiple voice and chat interactions are in queue, the chats will not be distributed to ready agents for voice and text until all voice interactions in that queue are engaged. Agent skill priority can only be set for calls and doesn't affect how chats will be distributed. Even though the initial priority for calls and chat can be set, this doesn't overrule that we always prioritize calls You can influence the priority of text interactions by setting waiting times, or starvation periods: after a number of seconds, the priority of a text interaction is changed from 3 or 2 to 1 so that the AID routes it first.

To give priority to a profile, set the starvation periods to a low number. Aligning VCC and SCC Priorities. Digital Engagement priorities range from 1-100, with 100 being the highest priority. These values are set in the Priority tab of the IVR Skill Transfer module and align with SCC priorities of one through three, with one being the highest priority. These priorities align as follows: l VCC priority 61-100 = SCC priority 1 l VCC priority 31-60 = SCC priority 2 l VCC priority 0-30 = SCC priority 3 To avoid starvation, set priorities to VCC 100/SCC 1, VCC 99/SCC 2, VCC 98/SCC 3 for existing items in queue.

The high priority interactions are routed before the medium priority interactions, which are routed before the low priority interactions. Business Rules and Interaction Processing By default, Agent Desktop Plus assigns incoming interactions the MEDIUM priority and routes items to agents on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. Any business rules that you define to override the default FIFO round-robin routing algorithm take precedence over the system defaults. For example, you might define business rules that a HIGH priority to items coming into the queue from a certain Facebook fan page; those interactions Understanding Digital Channels Priority of Text Interactions 21 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide will be processed first, and might even be sent to agents belonging to a specific skill group.

  "Interactions 21 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide will be processed first, and might even be sent to agents belonging to a specific skill group. In addition to business rules, you set starvation periods to prevent items of MEDIUM and LOW priorities don’t wait endlessly in the media queue. A starvation period is the period of time an item waits for some action such as, assignment to an agent or transfer of an item to a different agent or returning the item to the media queue. As the NLP engine learns to recognize terms used in text interactions for a certain profile, it might also assign priorities to incoming items as they enter the queue. Priority Updates for Items in the Media Queue After an item enters the media queue, the priority can be based on activity, rules, and waiting times. These events can increase the priority: l An item reaches the maximum waiting time for a specified starvation period. l An item is transferred to another agent. l An item is returned to the media queue because it was not accepted by an agent before the time-out. When an item is returned to the media queue, the priority is automatically",

  "Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide Enable Comfort Message Define the automated comfort messages displayed to a contact if the agent is taking too long to reply. The timer begins when the customer responds and restarts when the agent sends a message. Similarly, inactivity by the contact can start an option to automatically close the chat window. The customer-idle time restarts when a chat interaction is transferred to another agent. If you use the agent-idle timer and the automatic close option you can potentially send confusing messages to your customers. You must carefully plan the timing of your agent-idle timer messages and the close inactive interaction timer to avoid these situations. In this scenario, the agent idle timer is configured for 30 seconds and an automatic close timer configured for 180 seconds. If agents are unresponsive, you can produce a confusing interaction for your customers, as outlined below: l The agent is busy. A comfort message is sent at 30th, 60th, and 90th second saying I am still researching your ... l At the same time, at the 90th second, a warning is displayed to the customer: I have not heard from you for a while... l Now the customer is",

If the number exists in other contact records in the list, it can be dialed without restrictions. This type of disposition has two options: o Apply to all numbers in this contact record: The dialer does not dial any number in the contact record, not just the dispositioned number. o Use timer to reactivate number: The dialer does not dial the number in the current campaign.

If an outbound campaign that uses these answering machine prompt/IVR dispositions dials many cell phone numbers, Five9 recommends setting a longer greeting time, such as 40 seconds, due to the often longer voicemail greeting messages. You can use branching logic or dynamic Text-to-Speech when leaving a message. For example, to configure an IVR script that plays a personalized message from the agent assigned to the call, you can configure a Case module, with the Agent.user_name variable and connect the branches to one Play module for each agent. Another example would be to leave a message with dynamic Text- to-Speech, which can play information such as an account balance to a client. 2 Click Done to save the new disposition. 3 Assign the disposition to a campaign profile.

  "ID is not passed, data manipulation is limited to the content of DynamicAttributes. Dynamic Attributes DynamicAttributes objects are key-value (KV) pairs, both string values, that serve as input and output for the Five9 Rules Engine. These attributes are unique to your domain. The Five9 Rules Engine accesses, modifies, then returns your KV list to the IVR with enhanced routing options or recommended actions for the agent. To pass attributes to your Five9 rules engine, follow these steps: 1 Request the parameters and attributes. You can create dynamic attributes to be passed to the Five9 rules engine by using an IVR Query module. In the example below you send a raw JSON request to dynamically extract attributes specific to campaign and interaction. Query JSON request: {\"CampaignID\": \"&&Call.campaign.id&&\",\"interaction.id\": \"&&Omni.interaction_id&&\",\"attributes: \"&&attributes&&\"} Five9 Engagement Workflow Configuring Your Five9 Rules 126 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide The value of attributes is also a simple JSON request, such as: {\"body\": \"\",\"number1\": \"555-123-4567\",\"cookie monster\": \"Cookies Yum!\"} 2 Capture the query response. You can configure the Query module response tab to create a JSON response object, such as this regular expression (RegEx) example: For this response: {\"status\": 1, \"numberOfRulesFired\": 1,\"attributes\": {\"body\": \"\",\"number1\": \"555-123-4567\", \"cookieMonster\": \"Cookies Yum!:}} The RegEx",

  "Administrator’s Guide Proactive Chat Proactive chat offers are tailored to enhance customer support and lead or sale conversion by using specific triggers, such as time spent on a page, a series of clicks, or mouse hover time. A customer makes repeated visits to a product description or an FAQ topic. You can offer assistance in the form of a chat. When the customer clicks Start Live Chat in one of your web pages, an interaction is queued for the next available chat agent. Preview Chat Preview chat is a subset of proactive chat that provides the same elements as proactive chat. Preview chat overrides proactive chat. Preview chat generates a proactive chat request based on the customer’s context data, browsing behavior, and demographic information. Agents can then prepare a personalized chat message before engaging the customer. To use preview and proactive chat, you must define separate preview and proactive chat profiles in the Digital Engagement Administrator interface.

In this instance, the name and email fields are populated with <PhoneNumber>@anonymous.com. Example:9255551212@anonymous.com. Alphanumeric & Shortcodes Shortcodes, typically five to six digits long, allow for direct customer engagement through SMS or MMS, enabling significantly higher messaging volumes in shorter durations compared to standard long codes or Toll-Free Numbers (TFNs). At Five9, Shortcodes are currently limited to the US. Shortcodes are designed for high-throughput messaging, such as programmatic or broadcast communications, with default capacities reaching up to 100 messages per second. They are tailored for specific use cases and can serve as an effective alternative to long codes when facing carrier-imposed restrictions on message delivery. Common use cases for Shortcodes include system or account alert notifications, promotional or marketing alerts, two-factor authentication (2FA) or one-time passwords, and reminders for upcoming payments or appointments. Shortcodes are designated for messaging within the specific countries they're provisioned for. Therefore, a US Shortcode wouldn't be suitable if your audience isn't in the US.

Therefore, a US Shortcode wouldn't be suitable if your audience isn't in the US. Additionally, Shortcodes require explicit user consent for SMS messaging; usage without consent is prohibited. There are restrictions on the type of content and campaigns allowed via Shortcodes, as determined by Five9 and carriers. Prohibited uses include campaigns without verifiable user consent, adult content, lead generation-only services, and messaging for multiple financial entities. It's essential for a single entity to manage any campaign to maintain control over message content and frequency. Configuring SMS Interactions 247 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide While certain use cases like age-restricted content and direct lender services are permitted, they're subject to additional carrier requirements and may encounter delays in provisioning.

Additionally, Shortcode messaging campaigns must be managed by a single entity to ensure consistency in message content and delivery frequency. Allowed use cases include age-restricted content (Tobacco, Alcohol, etc.), sweepstakes or contests, and loan-related use cases for direct lenders. However, they may undergo additional scrutiny and take longer than usual to provision. Shortcodes are provisioned through the Admin Console and anchored to numbering definitions. The Five9 provisioning team handles Shortcode provisioning after the registration process is completed. Please refer to the registration requirement section to understand what's necessary to register for a Shortcode number.

Failure to incorporate these mandatory elements will result in carriers rejecting the consent flow. l A letter of authorization from the brand appearing in your messaging. l A compliant screenshot, link, or mockup of the SMS Terms of Service is required. While these terms do not need to be actively published on your website during the application process, a draft must be submitted for carrier approval of the Shortcode program. Ensure that the SMS Terms URL is activated before the launch of the Shortcode program. Once the application is submitted, Five9’s internal review of the submitted materials will take a week. It will then be sent to carriers for approval through our integrator. Major carriers take about six to ten weeks to approve.

Regulations Applicable Regulations applicable for Shortcodes: l Five9 will not approve Shortcode applications that do not comply with our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). l Customers are required to adhere to the regulations set forth by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). l Before forwarding applications to carriers for review, Five9's providers conduct their compliance assessments. These providers may enforce their policies, which, while generally in agreement with carrier standards, dictate what they will accept or decline for submission. l The CTIA, a carrier trade association, mandates specific guidelines for Shortcode campaigns as outlined in the CTIA Shortcode Compliance Handbook. l It's important to note that carriers reserve the right to approve or reject any use case on their network, regardless of whether all stipulated requirements have been satisfied.

Configuring SMS Interactions 254 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide SMS Options Opt-in/Opt-out Regulation U.S. regulatory and telecommunication industry rules governing businesses and organizations' use of SMS to communicate with Consumers ensure that they only receive SMS communications they want to receive from businesses or organizations. SMS consumers should have a transparent opt-in/opt-out mechanism. Consumers must consent to all recurring messages; entering a mobile phone number does not necessarily constitute a compliant opt-in. For these reasons, Organizations sending SMS to consumers need to provide an option for Consumers to opt-in. It then needs to follow up by sending a confirmation message to the user. For recurring message programs, confirmation messages must include clear opt-out instructions. Messages should also remind consumers from time to time that they are still enrolled – This is a recommended process to sign-up Consumers for regulatory Opt-in/Opt-out SMS features.

  "Messages should also remind consumers from time to time that they are still enrolled – This is a recommended process to sign-up Consumers for regulatory Opt-in/Opt-out SMS features. Blocking Objectionable Content You may have set up a method to report spam and objectionable content. Five9 does not filter the media for unwanted or disallowed content, such as SHAFT. SHAFT is an acronym for sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco. SHAFT guidelines should be taken seriously by any businesses communicating with their customers to ensure that they comply with Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA) guidelines. Any messages that contain prohibited content are likely to be blocked by carriers. For more information, see CTIA.

SMS service providers segment SMS messages based on the number of characters in a message, and count each segment within a message as a single unit. If an SMS message contains 200 characters, it is counted as two SMS messages: one containing 160 characters (maximum per segment), and one containing 40 characters. Character encoding type affects how the number of characters are counted. A message containing special (Unicode or non-GSM) characters are counted as additional segments. For example, the following message contains 206 characters and is billed as four segments. \"Name, you are considering school, that’s great!

Yes SMS Surcharges Telecommunication companies in the United States and Canada apply SMS surcharges due to operational, regulatory, and infrastructural factors. Carriers impose these additional costs for sending and receiving text messages to meet specific needs within the telecommunications framework. Configuring SMS Interactions 326 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide Regulatory Environment The regulatory environment directly drives SMS surcharges in the United States and Canada. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates telecommunications and allows carriers to charge fees to comply with regulations. These fees cover the cost of spam monitoring, network integrity, and security enforcement through systems like STIR/SHAKEN. Similarly, Canadian carriers face regulations that require compliance with strict SMS policies, including spam prevention and pricing structures.

  "regulations. These fees cover the cost of spam monitoring, network integrity, and security enforcement through systems like STIR/SHAKEN. Similarly, Canadian carriers face regulations that require compliance with strict SMS policies, including spam prevention and pricing structures. Operational Costs Operational expenses for maintaining and upgrading network infrastructure contribute to SMS surcharges. Carriers incur costs for customer support, network upgrades, and data management. For example, carriers offset the transition to technologies like 5G by increasing surcharges for services that use existing infrastructure. Carrier Fees and Interoperability Carriers impose fees for interoperability between networks, which SMS messages rely on to reach recipients. These fees cover the infrastructure required for transmitting messages across different carrier networks. Carriers also charge surcharges for Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging, where businesses send high volumes of messages that require prioritized routing. Market Dynamics and Competition Market competition influences SMS surcharge strategies. Leading carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, Bell, and Telus use surcharges to sustain revenue, fund new technologies, and compete effectively.

Note: SSO-related information from all Five9 Plus Adapter administration guides was moved into this document. 6 Single Sign-On • Administrator’s Guide Using Single Sign-On with Five9 Applications Single sign-on enables you to synchronize authentication and authorization data between your application and Five9 so that users can access both systems simultaneously: l If you enable single sign-on, your agents use only one set of credentials to automatically log into the adapter when they log into your application. l If you do not enable single sign-on, your agents must use two sets of credentials to log into your application and Five9 separately. This guide describes how to configure single sign-on with commonly used identity providers. To determine if your current IT infrastructure can support single sign-on configuration, refer to the Technical Requirements Reference Guide. Prerequisites Configuration Overview Prerequisites Ensure that the following requirements are met before configuring single sign-on. Contact your Five9 support representative for more information. Ensure that your domain is enabled for Five9 Plus applications. Five9 supports identity providers that adhere to the SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) specification.

Five9 Domains and Application Short Names During the single sign-on configuration, you need to provide URLs that include your Five9 domain and the short name that Five9 uses for your CRM application. Individual configuration tasks require specific URL formats, but generally use this format where you substitute <five9_domain> with your Five9 domain and <application> with the appropriate application short name. https://<five9_domain>/appsvcs/saml/SSO/alias/<application> For example, the following is the identifier URL format to use when you configure SSO for Azure. This URL example is for the Agent Desktop Plus application and the location is the US. https://app.five9.com/appsvcs/saml/SSO/alias/agent For SSO configuration tasks that require a similar URL, use the URL format specified in the configuration instructions. Before you begin the configuration, become familiar with your domain and your application short name.

The dialing process is typically handled by the dialer. Outbound campaigns may use one of four dialing modes: the predictive, power, or progressive dialer modes to dial through a list of contacts and deliver connected calls to your agents. An additional preview dialing mode allows agents to preview contacts and individually dial their numbers.

When managing outbound campaigns, you must understand how the dialer works and how lists are processed. For more information, see Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns. Inbound Campaigns Inbound campaigns are used to receive customer calls coming from a DNIS. The calls are processed according to your rules in the IVR script of the campaign. With the inbound campaign, you can use customized greetings and create different scenarios for Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 10 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide Interactive Voice Response (IVR).

You can collect caller information. l You can use contact data. l If queue times are long or agents are unavailable, callers can leave a message. l Calls can be forwarded to a third party when agents are not available. l You can prioritize inbound call traffic. etc. To create IVR scripts that automate skills-based call routing, see Routing Users to Skill Groups in the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Administrator's Guide. The campaign must be running to answer inbound calls. Otherwise, callers hear a busy signal. Autodial Campaigns Autodial campaigns are designed to dial phone numbers in a list and to use call- progress detection to understand whether the call was received by an answering machine or person. When a call is answered, it follows a predefined IVR Script. The most common flows include leaving messages to the called party. You can also optionally configure the auto-dialer so that your customers can interact with a menu of options and messages, and even allow them to add their phone number to the do-not- call list without interacting with an agent. So, with Five9’s advanced capabilities you can define many different flows to",
  "can also optionally configure the auto-dialer so that your customers can interact with a menu of options and messages, and even allow them to add their phone number to the do-not- call list without interacting with an agent. So, with Five9’s advanced capabilities you can define many different flows to meet your business needs. And each successfully connected number will follow the call flow defined for the campaign. The call flow can even pass an outbound call to an agent. When one of your customers needs to talk to a live agent, the call can be queued up for the next available agent. When your agents are connected to live parties, they can follow the scripts you've written and record the results in the Five9 contact history. Autodial Campaigns can dial multiple numbers at the same time based on the number of lines available for your account and the number of lines allocated to the campaign. There is an ability to stop dialing based on agent availability.

Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 11 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide If your call flow does not have the possibility to deliver calls to agents, you need to consider only running it at the times when you want to deliver your messages to your customer base. You can either manually start and stop campaigns or use a profile to help you in delivering your messages at targeted times. Autodial Information in Reports Telemarketing Rules Types of Autodial Campaigns Campaign Profiles for Autodial Campaigns Dispositions for Autodial Campaigns Testing Autodial Campaigns Autodial Information in Reports To determine if a contact hangs up before listening to the entire message, check the total length of the call in reports. If the call is shorter than the length of your message, you know the contact hung up before the message completed.

To view the IVR path taken for each autodial call, look at reports, which may contain an ivr_flow column. This column shows the IVR modules used by the call. Because the ivr_flow field uses the module name, Five9 recommends to identify each step of the call flow by naming each module accordingly. Telemarketing Rules You are responsible to know and comply with the telemarketing regulations in the regions in which you operate. Consult your compliance team if you are not sure about applicable laws. In the U.S., autodial campaigns are governed by the Federal Trade Commission’s telemarketing sales rule. You may not use an autodialer for telemarketing purposes. You may use an autodialer only if you have an existing business relationship with the people you are calling. For example, they may be used for collections, feature announcements, reminders to existing customers, or for exempt organizations, such as charities or political campaigns.

Important Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 12 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide Types of Autodial Campaigns Autodial campaigns comprise these categories: l Basic Autodial Campaign: Plays a message to answering machines. The message in the Play modules can be the same or different. l Smart Autodial Survey: Plays a prompt to the connected party and records the response in a contact field. If an answering machine is detected, the system disconnects the call. See Configuring Autodial Agent Linkback Campaigns. l Automated message delivery campaigns: Plays a recorded message to persons and answering machines, for example to broadcast a recorded message. l Agent Linkback: Usually plays a recorded message to answering machines but gives persons the option to connect to an agent.

Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 13 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide l Autodial Campaign to Record a Response in Voice mail: The Voicemail Transfer module plays a greeting providing instructions to the contact and asks to record the response. Campaign Profiles for Autodial Campaigns All campaign profile features can be used with autodial campaigns. For example, you can use a campaign profile to start and stop dialing automatically, based on the time of day. Use the Start At and Stop After settings to set the start and stop times. You can adjust more settings by using profiles. In the example below, the campaign dials between 8AM and 9PM to phone numbers in the number1 contact field of list records. Remember to account for time zones, as the dialing hours are based on the time zone of the phone number being dialed, not your local time zone.

Types of Campaigns Autodial Campaigns 14 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide See Outbound Campaign General Properties. Dispositions for Autodial Campaigns Because many autodial calls do not reach an agent, to be assigned a disposition, autodial campaigns can record a disposition in some IVR modules. The purpose of IVR dispositions is to provide reporting of where the call disconnected in the IVR flow. For example, your autodial campaign plays a message when a person answers and disconnects the call with the Hang Up module. The disposition in the Hang Up module is recorded as the result of the call. In this case, the disposition for the Hang Up module can be message left - person. Autodial campaigns have two disposition categories: l Agent dispositions are used when a call is connected to a Five9 agent. l IVR dispositions are used by the system when a call is disconnected during the IVR flow. To determine which IVR dispositions are required, create an IVR flow first, and add the dispositions as needed. You can also use the default dispositions assigned by the system.

After completing the new list, it continues with the original list from the position where it left off. Dialing ratios force the dialer to call records from multiple lists at specified frequencies (number of times). The dialing ratio is an optional function and can be defined in the Campaign Properties. For example, if your campaign has separate lists with hot and cold leads, you may dial hot leads more often than cold ones, without excluding any leads. While the dialer attempts to dial lists at their configured ratios, the actual number of connected calls may not completely match this ratio, due to factors like call results and list lengths that do not match the configured ratio.

Although campaign B has lower priority, it is busier because it has 10 agents. Priority is ignored if the campaign has only one agent. Configuring Campaign Ratio You can assign dialer resources spent on your running outbound campaigns based on their importance in your business. Changes to campaign ratio are effective immediately. The default setting for campaign ratio is 50 when campaign ratio is enabled in your domain. The range is 1–99. If you use campaign ratios, you must assign a ratio to the campaign before running it the first time. Otherwise the default ratio of 50 is assigned. You are prompted to reset the ratio whenever you restart the campaign. l Campaign A ratio = 60. l Campaign B ratio = 50. l Campaign C ratio = 20. 130 dialing attempts are made: l Campaign A: 46% of dialing attempts (60/130) l Campaign B: 39% of dialing attempts (50/130) l Campaign C: 15% of dialing attempts (20/130) Dialing ratios may be ineffective for multiple campaigns when a wide difference exists in the",

Combining Campaign Priority and Ratio You can combine campaign priority and dialing ratio to specify how the dialer should distribute calls of multiple campaigns with the same, or different, priorities. The main goal of the outbound dialer is to generate enough traffic to keep all the agents busy without exceeding your maximum calls abandoned percentage criteria. Keeping in mind the goal of the dialer, the concept of combining ratio and priority is simply to give a campaign with the highest",
  "The main goal of the outbound dialer is to generate enough traffic to keep all the agents busy without exceeding your maximum calls abandoned percentage criteria. Keeping in mind the goal of the dialer, the concept of combining ratio and priority is simply to give a campaign with the highest priority/ration the chance to be the first campaign to generate calls. This basic reasoning also assumes that all the campaigns considered have the same amount of agents logged in and ready. When that campaign with the highest priority cannot generate sufficient traffic then the next highest campaign has the opportunity to place calls, and so on. Additionally, there are several reasons why a campaign may not generate enough calls, such as: l A campaign is out of numbers to dial l A campaign has no numbers to dial at the moment, but some may become available later for these reasons: o State dialing rules o Redial timers are assigned to numbers o Do Not Dial timers are assigned to numbers o Filters that are configured in the campaign profile l A higher priority campaign does not yet have enough calling statistics compared to a lower priority campaign. This typically happens",
  "o State dialing rules o Redial timers are assigned to numbers o Do Not Dial timers are assigned to numbers o Filters that are configured in the campaign profile l A higher priority campaign does not yet have enough calling statistics compared to a lower priority campaign. This typically happens with a recently started campaign, which cannot dial aggressively due to this deficiency in statistics. l A higher priority campaign is close to reaching the Max Abandon Call criteria, this causes the dialer to slow down resulting in lower priority campaigns placing calls.

For example, the autodial campaign sees that an agent is available and starts to dial for that agent. Before an answered call is delivered to the agent, the agent goes on break. The message can be played immediately after a call is answered or after checking a skill group first. Below are sections of an IVR flow demonstrating both options. The Play module is first in line with a message stating the reason for the call and then uses a Skill Transfer module to check for agents. The first Skill Transfer module checks for an agent, with no queue time. If no agents are available, it immediately plays a message using the Play module. After the message has been played, the call is sent to a second Skill Transfer module. The first Skill Transfer module should be set up with no queue time.

Using the Priority Setting in IVR Modules In the second example above you want to ensure that the calls waiting on hold are answered before any new calls. The people on hold are obviously interested in talking to an agent. You can accomplish this by using the Priority setting in the second Skill Transfer module. Calls with a higher priority are answered before other calls. In the properties of the second Skill Transfer module select the Priority tab, click Increase Priority By, and set the value to 1.

Agent Assignment for Text Channel Interactions The following rules apply to agent assignment for text channel interactions. Note Modules Agent/Voice Mail Transfer Module 103 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide Transferring to a Specific Agent An interaction is assigned to an agent when the agent identified by the agent transfer module is: l Logged in l Ready l Available l Not at interaction capacity Transferring to Any Available Agent To transfer to any available agent, select to enable the Transfer to any available agent option. The text interaction is routed to any available agent, chosen using longest-wait algorithm. If there are no available agents then the interaction is routed to the default skill for the profile. Because you may not use call variables that contain sensitive information in this field, these variables do not appear in the menu even if they exist in the Call Variables folder of the VCC. For text channel interactions, Five9 stops processing the IVR script after using an agent transfer module regardless of agent availability. If a user abandons the",
  "sensitive information in this field, these variables do not appear in the menu even if they exist in the Call Variables folder of the VCC. For text channel interactions, Five9 stops processing the IVR script after using an agent transfer module regardless of agent availability. If a user abandons the chat session while waiting for an agent to accept that interaction, it is not assigned to the agent selected by the agent transfer module. The Text Channels Administrator Console setting Ignore Agent Interaction Limits for Transfers and Conferences does not apply to interaction limits for this module. The text interaction is assigned to an agent only if the current interaction capacity is less than the maximum allowable capacity, regardless of this option setting in SCC. Agent/Voicemail Assignment for Voice Interactions This module enables voice interaction transfer to agent, skill, or voicemail options to exit an IVR script.

  "Applies if you enabled the answering machine tone option. Number of seconds to wait for the answering machine greeting. The default is 20 seconds. Case Module The Case module enables you to create as many branches as you need to handle all the possible user input or the information contained in a variable. Each possible case must have its own branch. A Get Digits module contains this prompt: For Sales, press 1. For Support, press 2. The Get Digits module is followed by the Case module that contains the BUFFER variable with the values 1, which is leads to the Sales branch, and 2, which is leads to the Support branch. In this case, the Case module has three branches: Sales, Support, and No Match to handle all other caller input. For more example, see also Creating an IVR Script and Creating an IVR Loop.

  "Custom prompt in your Prompts folder Estimated Wait Time Estimated Wait Time (EWT) uses a sophisticated algorithm to predict the wait time for callers within the skill and uses these two consistent metrics: l EWT = The position of the caller in the queue divided by the Skill Answer Rate.

Configure the Skill Transfer module of the Support branch to route the call to the appropriate skill group. Configuring the No Match Branch Now that we have the flow of the script, we need to configure the script to handle wrong input from the caller. For this we use the No Match branch of the Case module. In our example, if caller makes an invalid entry (a number other than 1 or 2), they can repeat the input. After five consecutive invalid entries, the call is disconnected. If the caller's entry is invalid, we repeat the voice message instructions and have the caller try again. To trace the number of invalid entries, create the variable loop_var in the Variables tab to contain the number of allowed wrong entries (by default, Initial Value is 5).
